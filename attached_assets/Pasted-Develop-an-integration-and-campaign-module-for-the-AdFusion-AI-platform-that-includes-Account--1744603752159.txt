Develop an integration and campaign module for the AdFusion AI platform that includes:

    Account Connection & Security:

        Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both Google Ads and Facebook Marketing.

        Request necessary permissions for campaign management and performance reporting.

        Securely store and manage access/refresh tokens with encryption and ensure all API calls use HTTPS.

    Campaign Publishing:

        Build functions to map our campaign settings (budget, targeting, creative assets) into the required formats for Google Ads API and Facebook Marketing API.

        Implement API calls to create, update, and publish campaigns seamlessly.

        Include basic error handling and feedback to users.

    Performance Data Retrieval:

        Develop a mechanism to fetch key performance metrics (CTR, impressions, conversions, CPC, etc.) either through periodic polling or via webhooks.

        Aggregate and provide data in a simple, accessible format (e.g., for a dashboard).

    Creative Generation and Customization:

        Integrate AI engines for generating ad creatives: use NLP for text generation and text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for visual creatives.

        Integrate AI-driven video ad generation (via text-to-video models) that allows users to create, preview, and edit video ad creatives.

        Provide a user-friendly UI (or API endpoints) that lets users manually adjust creatives (fonts, colors, layout, etc.) and review the creative generation process for transparency.

    Advanced Analytics:

        Offer a basic analytics dashboard that displays real-time performance data.

        Support features like A/B testing to compare creative variations and optimize campaign performance.

    Modularity & Testing:

        Structure the code using a modular approach to allow future integration with additional platforms and advanced features.

        Write unit tests for key functions, including OAuth flows, campaign publishing, and error handling.

        Provide clear documentation for setup, configuration (including API keys and secrets), and usage of the module.
